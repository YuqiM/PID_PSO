#This script enables you to customize the PSO optimization of the PID feedback control of photonics MZI based inertial sensor
#The code performs Time domain simulation, outputs from the control as well as from photodiode is individually viewble
#Here you can set the:
- Sample frequency
- Environmental Excitation frequency
- Environmental Phase purturbation amplitude
- Basic Particle Swarm Optimization Capability
- Particle Number
- Search space boundary definition
- Number of time steps
- Social coefficients and Cognitive Coefficients
